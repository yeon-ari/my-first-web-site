    <h2>critical value</h2>
    <p>A critical value is the value of the test statistic which defines the upper and lower bounds of a confidence interval, 
        or which defines the threshold of statistical significance in a statistical test. 
        It describes how far from the mean of the distribution you have to go to cover 
        a certain amount of the total variation in the data (i.e. 90%, 95%, 99%).
        If you are constructing a 95% confidence interval and 
        are using a threshold of statistical significance of p = 0.05, 
        then your critical value will be identical in both cases.</p>
